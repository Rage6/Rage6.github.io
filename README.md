# Quick Yahtzee
### https://quick-yahtzee.herokuapp.com

**Purpose:** This code is essentially a shortened version of "Yahtzee", a traditional game of chance that involves dice. It is designed for two users to play the game on a single browser.

**Languages:** HTML, CSS (with SASS), Javascript (with jQuery)

**Mobile-friendly?:** Yes

"Quick Yahtzee" is the first, independent work that I ever made using Javascript and jQuery. It was truly eye-opening for me as I learned the amazing, interactive capabilities of a modern website's basic tools. This also abruptly taught me many of the common mistakes that a beginner developer makes, as well as how often unpredictable human mistakes cause major bugs. Finally, this game also forced me to thoroughly understand every interaction within its code.
