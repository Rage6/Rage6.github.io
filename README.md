# Quick Yahtzee
### https://quick-yahtzee.herokuapp.com

**Purpose:** This code is essentially a shortened version of "Yahtzee", a traditional game of chance that involves dice. It is designed for two users to play the game on a single browser.

**Languages:** HTML, CSS (with SASS), Javascript (with jQuery)

**Mobile-friendly?:** Yes

"Quick Yahtzee" is the first, independent work that I ever made using Javascript and jQuery. It was truly eye-opening for me as I learned the amazing, interactive capabilities of a modern website's basic tools. This also abruptly taught me many of the common mistakes that a beginner developer makes, as well as how often unpredictable human mistakes cause major bugs. Finally, this game also forced me to thoroughly understand every interaction within its code. 

***SCREEN LAYOUT***
- Laptop/Desktop: 
On the top of the screen are three buttons: RULES, HOW TO PLAY, and RESET SCORE. The RESET SCORE button simply refreshes this page which, in the process removes the player names and scores. A box appear after clicking RESET SCORE to confirm that the play does, in fact, want to reset the game.

- Mobile: 

***HOW TO PLAY***

As soon as the browser recieves the server's response, two prompts take place. This is where each user can enter their desired name. If a player leaves their prompt blank, then their default name will be "Player 1" or "Player 2". An alert then follows with a brief description of how to start the game, after which the first player can begin.
