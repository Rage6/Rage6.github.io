# Quick Yahtzee
### Rage6.github.io

**Purpose:** This code is essentially a shortened version of "Yahtzee", a traditional game of chance that involves dice. It is also the first, independent work that I ever made using Javascript and jQuery. It was truly an eye-opener for me as I learned the amazing capabilities of a modern websites and Javascript. It also abruptly taught me the common mistakes that a beginner developer, the coding complexity of a seemingly easy human game, and how often unpredictable human errors can cause major coding problems. 

**Languages:** HTML, CSS, jQuery
