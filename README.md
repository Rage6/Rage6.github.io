"Quick Yahtzee" is the first, independent work that I ever made using Javascript and jQuery. It was truly an eye-opener for me as I learned the amazing capabilities of modern websites and user interaction. It also abruptly taught me many of the common mistakes that a beginner developer makes, the coding complexity of a seemingly easy human game, and how often unpredictable human mistakes can cause major coding errors. Finally, it forced me to thoroughly understand every interaction within my complex code, without which I would never have found my game's errors.
